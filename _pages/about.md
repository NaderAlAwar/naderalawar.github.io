I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer
Engineering department at The University of Texas at Austin, advised
by [Prof. Milos Gligoric](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/). I am
interested in High Performance Computing and Software Engineering. I
completed my undergraduate degree in the ECE department at [The American
University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) in 2019.
