I am a fourth year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer
Engineering department at The University of Texas at Austin, advised
by [Prof. Milos Gligoric](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/). I am
interested in Compilers, High Performance Computing, and Software Engineering.

I am the lead developer of [PyKokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/pykokkos), a
Python framework for writing performance portable kernels in Python. Using PyKokkos,
I have written high-performance software entirely in Python, including a Python
port of [ExaMiniMD](https://github.com/kokkos/pykokkos/tree/main/examples/ExaMiniMD/standalone)
a [molecular dynamics mini application](https://github.com/ECP-copa/ExaMiniMD),
a [particle-in-cell (PIC) solver](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9980962)
of the electron Boltzmann equation, and various [machine learning](https://github.com/kokkos/pykokkos/tree/main/examples/NaiveBayes)
[algorithms](https://github.com/kokkos/pykokkos/tree/main/examples/LogisticRegression).
More recently, I have been working on lazy evaluation and kernel fusion for PyKokkos.

My other work includes [Tempo](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485543), a CUDA framework
for writing test generation programs, and [WayOut](https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/wayout)
a framework for automatic generation of Python language bindings for C++ code.

I am on the job market in 2024, find my most recent resume [here](https://naderalawar.github.io/files/CV_AlAwar_2024.pdf).
